## Overview

The objective of this module is to deploy a Google Cloud Platform project `prj-cicd` to host a Jenkins Agent that can be used to deploy your infrastructure changes. This module is a replica of the [cloudbuild module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-bootstrap/tree/master/modules/cloudbuild), but re-purposed to use jenkins instead of Cloud Build. This module creates:
- The `prj-cicd` project to hold the Jenkins Agent
- GCE Instance for the Jenkins Agent, assigning SSH public keys in the metadata to allow connectivity from the Jenkins Master.
- FW rules to allow communication over port 22
  - TODO: use a fixed IP or no public IP at all
-  Custom Service account to run the Jenkins Agent's GCE Instance

Please note this module does not include an option to create a Jenkins Master. To deploy a Jenkins Master, you should follow one of the available user guides in https://cloud.google.com/jenkins.

If you don't have a Jenkins implementation and don't want one, then we recommend you to use the Cloud Build module instead of this Jenkins module.

## Usage

Basic usage of this sub-module is as follows:

```hcl
module "jenkins_bootstrap" {
  source                                  = "./modules/jenkins-agent"
  org_id                                  = "<ORGANIZATION_ID>"
  folder_id                               = "<FOLDER_ID>"
  billing_account                         = "<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID>"
  group_org_admins                        = "gcp-organization-admins@example.com"
  default_region                          = "us-central1"
  terraform_sa_email                      = "<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>" # normally module.seed_bootstrap.terraform_sa_email
  terraform_sa_name                       = "<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME>" # normally module.seed_bootstrap.terraform_sa_name
  terraform_state_bucket                  = "<GCS_STATE_BUCKET_NAME>" # normally module.seed_bootstrap.gcs_bucket_tfstate
  sa_enable_impersonation                 = true
  jenkins_master_ip_addresses             = ["10.1.0.6/32"]
  jenkins_agent_gce_subnetwork_cidr_range = "10.2.0.0/24"
  jenkins_agent_gce_private_ip_address    = "10.2.0.6"
  nat_bgp_asn                             = "BGP_ASN_FOR_NAT_CLOUD_ROUTE"
  jenkins_agent_sa_email                  = "jenkins-agent-gce" # service_account_prefix will be added
  jenkins_agent_gce_ssh_pub_key           = var.jenkins_agent_gce_ssh_pub_key
}
```

1. While developing only - Run `$ gcloud auth application-default login` before running `$ terraform plan` to avoid the errors below:
```
Error: google: could not find default credentials. See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials for more information.
   on <empty> line 0:
  (source code not available)
```

```
Error: Error setting billing account "aaaaaa-bbbbbb-cccccc" for project "projects/cft-jenkins-dc3a": googleapi: Error 400: Precondition check failed., failedPrecondition
      on .terraform/modules/jenkins/terraform-google-project-factory-7.1.0/modules/core_project_factory/main.tf line 96, in resource "google_project" "main":
      96: resource "google_project" "main" {
```

```
Error: failed pre-requisites: missing permission on "billingAccounts/aaaaaa-bbbbbb-cccccc": billing.resourceAssociations.create

```

## Features

1. Creates a new GCP project using `project_prefix`
1. Enables APIs in the project using `activate_apis`
1. Creates a GCE Instance to run the Jenkins Agent with SSH access using the supplied public key
1. Creates a Service Account (`jenkins_agent_sa_email`) to run the Jenkins Agent GCE instance
1. Creates a GCS bucket for Jenkins Artifacts using `project_prefix`
1. Allows `jenkins_agent_sa_email` service account permissions to impersonate terraform service account (which exists in the `seed` project) using `sa_enable_impersonation` and supplied value for `terraform_sa_name`
1. Adds Cloud NAT for the Agent to be able to download updates and necessary binaries.

## Requirements

### Software

-   [gcloud sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) >= 206.0.0
-   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.12.6
-   [terraform-provider-google] plugin 2.1.x
-   [terraform-provider-google-beta] plugin 2.1.x

### Infrastructure

 - **Jenkins Master:** You need a Jenkins Master. Please note this module does not include an option to create a Jenkins Master. To deploy a Jenkins Master, you should follow one of the available user guides about [Jenkins in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/jenkins). If you don't have a Jenkins implementation and don't want one, then we recommend you to use the Cloud Build module instead of this Jenkins module.

 - **VPN Connectivity with on-prem:** Once you run this module and your Jenkins Agent is created in the CICD project in GCP, please add VPN connectivity manually by following our user guide about [how to deploy a VPN tunnel in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/how-to). This VPN configuration is necessary to allow communication between the Jenkins Master (on prem or in a cloud environment) with the Jenkins Agent in the CICD project. The reason why you add this connection manually is because you need to keep the VPN secret away from any configuration file, such as the Terraform state.

 - **Binaries and packages:** The Jenkins Agent needs to fetch several binaries needed to execute pipelines. These include `java`, `terraform`, `terraform-validator` and the binaries you use in your own scripts. You have several options to have these binaries and libraries available:
    - having Internet access (ideally through Cloud NAT, implemented by default).
    - having local package repositories on your premises that the Agent can reach out to through the VPN connection.
    - preparing a golden image for `jenkins_agent_gce_instance.boot_disk.initialize_params.image` using tools like Packer. Although, you might still need network access to download dependencies while running a pipeline.

### Permissions

- `roles/billing.user` on supplied billing account
- `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on GCP Organization
- `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` on GCP Organization or folder

### APIs

A project with the following APIs enabled must be used to host the
resources of this module:

- Google Cloud Resource Manager API: `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`
- Google Cloud Billing API: `cloudbilling.googleapis.com`
- Google Cloud IAM API: `iam.googleapis.com`
- Google Cloud Storage API `storage-api.googleapis.com`
- Google Cloud Service Usage API: `serviceusage.googleapis.com`
- Google Cloud Compute API: `compute.googleapis.com`
- Google Cloud KMS API: `cloudkms.googleapis.com`

This API can be enabled in the default project created during establishing an organization.

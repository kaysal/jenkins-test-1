# 3-networks/shared

The purpose of this step is to setup the global [DNS Hub](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/cloud-forwarding-peering-and-zones) that will be used by all environments.

## Prerequisites

1. 0-bootstrap executed successfully.
1. 1-org executed successfully.

## Usage

### Setup to run via Cloud Build
1. Clone repo `gcloud source repos clone gcp-networks --project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID`
1. Change freshly cloned repo and change to non master branch `git checkout -b plan-shared`
1. Copy contents of foundation to new repo `cp -R ../terraform-example-foundation/3-networks/* .` (modify accordingly based on your current directory)
1. Copy cloud build configuration files for terraform `cp ../terraform-example-foundation/build/cloudbuild-tf-* . ` (modify accordingly based on your current directory).
1. Change cloud build configuration files in order to `terraform init ./envs/shared`, `terraform plan ./envs/shared`, and `terraform apply ./envs/shared`.
1. Rename ./envs/shared/terraform.example.tfvars to ./envs/shared/terraform.tfvars and update the file with values from your environment and bootstrap.
1. Rename ./envs/shared/backend.tf.example to ./envs/shared/backend.tf and update with your bucket from bootstrap.
1. Commit changes with `git add .` and `git commit -m 'Your message'`
1. Push your non master branch to trigger a plan `git push --set-upstream origin plan-shared`
    1. Review the plan output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID
1. Merge changes to master with `git checkout -b master` and `git push origin master`
    1. Review the apply output in your cloud build project https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=YOUR_CLOUD_BUILD_PROJECT_ID


### Run terraform locally
1. Change into 3-networks/envs/shared folder
1. Rename terraform.example.tfvars to terraform.tfvars and update the file with values from your environment and bootstrap.
1. Rename backend.tf.example to backend.tf and update with your bucket from bootstrap.
1. Run `terraform init`
1. Run `terraform plan` and review output
1. Run `terraform apply`
